# vimyt

TUI for YouTube Music with vim keybindings and radio mixes. Built with Go, [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

Search, queue, playlists, artists, radio mixes, and history. All navigated with vim keybindings (`j/k`, `gg/G`, visual select, yank/delete/paste, undo/redo). Session state persists across launches.

Press `S` to open settings:

- Focus Queue on add
- Relative line numbers
- Pin Search / Playlist / Radio / Artists panels
- Show/Hide History / Radio History / Artists
- YT Auth -- browser cookie auth (Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge) for private playlists
- Import Playlist by URL
- Discord Rich Presence -- show the current track as a "Listening to ..." status

## Discord Rich Presence

vimyt can publish the currently playing track to Discord as a "Listening to ..."
status, with title, artist, album art, a progress bar, and an optional "Listen
on YT Music" button. It talks to a running Discord client over its local IPC
socket, so nothing extra needs to be installed.

Because Discord ties the activity name to an application, you supply your own
application ID the first time:

1. In settings (`S`), select **Set up Discord RPC**.
2. Follow the on-screen steps: create an application at
   [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
   copy its **Application ID**, and enable **Settings > Activity Privacy >
   Share your detected activities** in Discord.
3. Paste the Application ID and press Enter.

The application's name is what shows up as "Listening to <name>", so name it
whatever you want the status to read (e.g. "vimyt"). Once set up, Rich Presence
and the listen button are enabled by default and can be toggled in settings; the
setup entry becomes **Change Discord App ID**.

Set `VIMYT_DISCORD_APP_ID` to override the configured ID from the environment.

## Data Storage

Only metadata is stored locally. No audio or video is downloaded. Location depends on your OS:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/vimyt/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/vimyt/`
